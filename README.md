A play on vinyl, this is an ESP32 recreation of the vinyl experience.
The basic idea is that there are physical objects with albums tied to them RFID/QR code that causes a music player to play the music.
The goal is to allow anyone to play music in the house as well as encourage intentionality to the music you select.

Currently, this project relies on OwnTone, which can connect to Spotify or use your own music library.
The ESP32 just controls which speakers will play (AirPlay) as well as playback.

## How does it work

TBD: video here explaining how it works

## How do I make one myself?

See the documents folder that walks you through the process.

## Can I contribute?

Sure, open a PR or fork this project. I have a full-time job and a family, so I will not take feature requests (I'm not cheap if you're thinking you could pay me to do it).

## Can I run it locally?

Actually, yes!
Using emscripten, we have a simulator that tries to replicate the experience.
You can try it here: TBD.
